# location of caption and image

what is happing:
- The caption is in the middle big, like a main text, while the gif are being placed on random cornors.

what should happen:
- when the visual gif is found, it should be in center of screen. not covering full screen but in center from top to bottom and from left to right.
- when the visaul is found the caption should be small and youtube caption look alike. at the bottom in center to left to right.
- when no visual is foun the caption should become like a main text like it is right now.

context:
I’m developing a reading aid application that displays text and integrates GIFs to make content visually appealing. Right now, the application shows text line by line and then adds GIFs related to the text. I want to refine this so that it resembles the Fireship style: a dark background with dynamic text and GIF overlays. The text should be large and easy to read, and GIFs should be smaller overlays rather than full-screen. Also, if no GIF is available, the text should stand out on its own. The goal is to create a video-like experience that is both information.
